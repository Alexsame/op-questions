# op-questions

1. There are two parts for op1. In part1, you will answer simple c questions and debug and enhance a simple word counting program. In part2, you will explore and extend a simple Unix shell interpreter. Specific instructions are included in README.txt files in op1.

2. There are two parts for op2. In part1, you will fix a program which sorts strings using "enzymes." An enzyme is a function that sorts two consecutive characters. In part2, you will be implementing a simple multithreaded calculator. For example, given the string "4*(6+3)" as input, the expected output is the string "36." Specific instructions are included in README.txt files in op2.

3. There are two parts for op3. In part1, you will write a user-mode thread scheduler. This problem involves two different scheduling policies: First In First Out and Round Robin. In part2, you will simulate a time-sharing system by using signals and timers. Instead of using iterations to model the concept of "time slices", you will use interval timers. Specific instructions are included in README.txt files in op3.

4. There are two parts for op4. In part1, you will learn about and use POSIX file system calls. Specifically, you will implement a custom filesystem and test its performance using a filesystem benchmark (Bonnie benchmark). In part2, you will implement your own version of malloc() and free(), using a variety of allocation strategies (first-fit, best-fit and etc.). Specific instructions are included in README.txt files in op4.
